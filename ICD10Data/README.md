# ICD10Data.com
ICD10Data.com is a free reference website designed for the fast lookup of all current American ICD-10-CM (diagnosis) and ICD-10-PCS (procedure) medical billing codes.

The 2025 ICD-10-CM/PCS code sets are now fully loaded on ICD10Data.com. 
2025 codes became effective on October 1, 2024, therefore all claims with a date of service on or after this date should use 2025 codes.

# Method
This website is simple, but has some bot protection. Setting a user agent and a random request delay is enough. 
Both ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS codes are scraped. 
A small fraction of data (**data_A00toA99.jsonl** and **data_00.jsonl**) is uploaded.
